  <p>creativity</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
<p>Made a bunch of music no one has heard. Made a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1083800/Glitch_Arena/">game</a> that a few people liked. Created a vegan cheese once that did alright. I used to design websites, but as you can tell I don't do that anymore.</p>
 <p>These days I make <a href="https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/alidark3000">T-shirts</a> and take <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alidark3000/">Insta</a>.</p>
  <p>I also think. A lot.</p>
