<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This has been a great hobby for the last four or so half years, alongside a design career. That career isn't going as well as I'd like so I'm looking forward to switching into a more engaging creative avenue</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Experience in:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">designing and developing a released multiplayer FPS game<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">designing levels for said indie AFPS and the cancelled but alive Unreal Tournament 4<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s1">designing and developing a multiplayer platformer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Designing and Developing Glitch Arena</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Concept and Gameplay</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chronologically, I was designing levels and making mods for for UT4, then making a platformer, then working on Glitch Arena, but I'll introduce Glitch first as it's the magnum opus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Glitch was first proposed to my partner in all things game and level, Joel Reeves, who I met through the Australian UT4 community. He helped playlets levels and has had input in most of what I’ve done. The initial pitch to him was for an AFPS that took the basic principles of AFPS and presented them as minimally as possible. The idea behind this was that complicated game systems and rules added nothing to the fun, and a simple array of pickups and tools could be more fun in conjunction with good level design. I think we proved this (!) but you decide. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
