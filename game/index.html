      <h1>Game & Level Design Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Having worked decades in design and web, I'm looking to spend the next decades using those design skills in level design. I love games and level design for two main reasons: they are creatively inspiring; and personally challenging. It started with the Sonic the Hedgehog series, then Quake, and later Unreal Tournament. </p>

            <p>It wasn't until UT4 in 2017 that I took up the challenge to open the editor and make levels of my own. And boy was it addicting. I was completely activated: creating beautiful levels challenged my right brain. Creating functional levels challenged my left brain. And testing and iterating - being both the maker and the user, completed the designer in me. </p> 

      <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>To contribute to a team that values level design beyond pretty graphics and polygon counts.</p>

        <p>Experience in a nutshell:</p>
        <ul>
             <li>designing levels for an indie AFPS.  
            <li>level design for the cancelled (but still great) UT4.
            <li>designing and developing a released multiplayer FPS game. 
            <li>designing levels for an indie multiplayer platformer (that I also made). 
        </ul>

        <h2 id="glitch">Glitch Arena</h2>
        <p><em>Designed, developed and released multiplayer FPS</em></p>
        <p>Glitch Arena is an Arena First Person Shooter. It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1083800/Glitch_Arena/">published on Steam</a>. 
        <p>Everything I learned mapping for Unreal Tournament was poured into this and then some. I did a lot for this game (including programming in Unreal Engine blueprints, making materials and music tracks and sound effects) but the level design is what makes Glitch stand apart. </p>

        <p>Glitch was first proposed to take the basic principles of AFPS and present them as minimally as possible. It's inspired by the two main strands of AFPS, Quake and Unreal Tournament, resulting in a fast and fluid game like Quake that also has the more exciting multiplayer engagements of Unreal.</p>

        <h3>Level Design</h3>
        <p>Building a unique game, I enjoyed making levels to support the new ideas.  The levels took shape alongside the gameplay, over time. They are defiantely informed by other AFPS levels, however I wanted to create a group of highly unique maps that explored what was possible. There's more work to do here, but I'm very proud of a few of them.</p>

        <p> This video features Joel and I duelling on "Key3" (the working title stuck), probably the most realised map in the game. The gameplay is from Joel's POV. His feedback was crucial while working on Key3.</p>

        <h2>UT4 Levels: Dying Sun & Lathe</h2>

        <p>Having played Unreal Tournament heavily since 2015, I started making maps and mods for the game in 2017. The best of these maps was Dying Sun, which evolved into a new circular version of the map, Lathe.</p>

        <p>The meta concept for Dying Sun is a strict separation of in control and out of control routes. In AFPS duel, players struggle for control, by which they maintain a position in which they can defend and keep the major items on a map. Players must know how to keep control, but also how to play "out of control" without dying, but while slowly winning back control. For Dying Sun, we intended to correct a problem with Unreal Tournament, in which control was too easy to keep and too hard to win back. I say 'we' because the idea was very much developed with from Joel.</p>

        <p>We did this by placing major items in Dying Sun at the ground level, in hard-to-defend and easy-to-attack locations. We also respawned players at a top level, with plenty of weapons and minor items to choose from, meaning they could easily restock and restack, and get reprive from the in control player's onslaught. </p>

        <p>The main features of the map are two lifts, located at opposite ends of the map, which served as the only ways from the lower levels to the top (except for one jump pad).Because of these strong sound cues, the top level player would always know when the bottom level player was attempting to track them down.</p> 

        <p>Dying Sun reached 100 playtested iterations before final release. Go on, watch them all! Or maybe just one:</p>

        <p>Lathe kept these most important features from Dying Sun, and was more an experiment in Unreal Engine's geometry.</p>

        <p>I made another couple of maps after these two, however these two recieved the most attention and represent what I learned from mapping for Unreal Tournament.</p>

        <h2 id="ff">Frag Forest</h2>
        <p><em>Design and development</em></p>

        <p>Frag forest was my first attempt at a game. It currently exists as a playable, but unpublished prototype. </p>
        <p>I had been lamenting for some time that my favourite genre was doomed because of the high barrier to entry that mechanical skills presented. These are skills that need to be practiced before the game can be enjoyed. The main prohibitive skills are mouse aim and movement abilities such as strafe jumping. While one of the good things about AFPS is the high skill ceiling, these games sadly require a huge investment of time. </p>
        <p>I was wondering if the non-mechanical aspects of the genre are independently enjoyable. What if those elements were available in a more accessible format? This sparked Frag Forest. The idea was to translate the important elements of the Arena First Person Shooter genre, but into a 2D format that could be played with less mechanical skill. In this sense it’s a direct theoretical precursor to Glitch. </p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p> Unlike Glitch, before I started building the game - which was quite a scary as until this point I had only been learning Unreal Engine by modding for Unreal Tournament - I prepared a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUST-kAZxvKzK-CfCFrfNk4s92FY9FuZjBOmSMg1gJs/edit?usp=sharing">game design document</a> and shared it with Joel, who helped refine it. Once I got into development and we were play testing the game, things evolved a little, but we remained faithful to the basic concept. <p>

        <p>There is some gameplay from Frag Forest testing in the "Can AFPS be Easy" video above, in the <a href="#glitch">Glitch section</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="mods">Mods for UT4</h2>

        <p>After having started in mapping, I became interested in modding for Unreal Tournament. I guess it was pure creative curiousity. I had some ideas, and wanted to see how they played out. Doing this was how I learned to code in UE4 Blueprints, and key to building the confidence to make games. Multiplayer networking concepts particularly proved hard to learn, and boy did I put in the hard yards.</p>

        <h3>Airgun</h3>
        <p>This was my replacement started weapon for UT4, which was meant to replace the stock starting pistol, as well as the impact hammer that people could use to clear modest heights and increased map mobility.</p>

        <h3>Fluidity</h3>
        <p>Foreshadowing Glitch, fludity was my attempt to move the UT movement system towards Quake's. UT has very linear movement, while Quake's is fluid. Essentially, this allowed you to bunnyhop in UT.</p>

        <p> This video introduces both Airgun and Fluidity, as well as another good map I made Hack01.</p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QHc11kTI9rE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h3>Strafeboard</h3>
        <p>Strafeboard was another way to sneak fast and fluid movement into UT4, however in this case, it had precedent in the UT3 hoverboard. Players in capture the flag were able to switch to a hoverboard to move around the larger maps much faster than otherwise.</p>

        <p>Strafeboard incorporated Quake style movement tech to increase speed while on the board, another homage to Quake and a precursor to developing 'Glitching' later on.</p>

        <h3>Jetpack</h3>
        <p>The Jetpack was designed as a new powerup for UT4. It worked pretty simply and as you'd imagine.</p>
