  <h1>Game & Level Design Portfolio</h1>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p> I’m most proficient in level design, with some ability to prototype in Unreal blueprints, and some experience with environments.</p> 
  
  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>To contribute to a team that values hugely fun and engaging gameplay - through great and original level design. </p>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Design levels and games have been a great hobby for the last give years, alongside a design career. I'm looking forward to switching into a more engaging creative avenue.</p>
  <p>I love the collaborative and iterative nature of game design. I value atmosphere over fidelity, and believe in creating fun through simple rules and well designed level devices</p> 
<p>Experience in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>designing and developing a released multiplayer FPS game 
	<li>designing levels for said indie AFPS and the cancelled but alive Unreal Tournament 4 
	<li>designing and developing a multiplayer platformer 
</ul>

<h2>Glitch Arena</h2>
<p>Design and development</p>
<p>Glitch Arena is an Arena First Person Shooter genre game. It’s published on Steam and mostly bug-free. Level design is ongoing. </p>
<p>Chronologically, I was designing levels and making mods for for UT4, then making a platformer, then working on Glitch Arena, but I'll introduce Glitch first as it's the magnum opus.</p>
<p>For this game I needed to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design best-in-class levels
	<li>Develop a fluid movement system in the linear ue4
	<li>Make blueprints for all actors and classes, from scratch
	<li>Design gameplay, gamemodes
	<li>Design levels for various gametypes
	<li>Produce level and menu music
	<li>Produce game sounds
	<li>Create pixel art materials with normals
	<li>Integrate basic Steam functions and Published game
</ul>

<h3>Concept</h3>

<p>Glitch was first proposed to my partner in all things game and level, Joel Reeves, who I met through the Australian UT4 community. He helped playtest levels and has had input in most of what I’ve done. The initial pitch to him was for an AFPS that took the basic principles of AFPS and presented them as minimally as possible. </p>

<p>We saw where the genre we loved was heading and regretted that it seemed to be getting more and more complicated. Glitch was meant from the start to be the antithesis of this. The idea is that that complicated game systems are a net negative. For AFPS at least, a simple array of pickups and tools could be more fun in conjunction with good level design. I think we proved this (!). We started with the absolute minimum of AFPS gameplay devices - weapons, armour, health and ammunition, and added a few nice-to-haves and differentiators. 
<p>
  
  <p>This video goes into some detail on our design and decision-making process: </p>

  <p>To pull out one example as a way we innovated on the genre with an essentialist approach, every other AFPS game offers ammunition for each weapon in the game separately. This increases the mental overhead. In Glitch you have a unified ammunition which each weapon in the game uses. This means you only need to track one value, learning maps is easier, and the gameplay can be picked up, and enjoyed, faster. </p>
  
  <p>The game was designed and built along with the levels, in Unreal Engine. It’s a blueprint only project as that’s how I code (and where I draw the line). At two and a half years into the project, there are a number of levels I’m really happy with. Of course making these took extensive collaboration and testing for which I have Joel to thank. </p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately interest in the game never allowed for testing team modes, including the original capture the balls mode, which is explained in this video (it was publicly playable for a while until I realised how buggy it was, but was thoroughly enjoyed by some). The idea was to improve on the Capture the Flag formula by highlighting the hide-and-seek nature of the mode (This forensic video of me hiding with the flag in UT4 explains what I mean!).  </p>
  
  <h3>Future</h3>
  
  <p>After more than two years of development, the core of Glitch is done and dusted. Level design, though, is an ongoing hobby. </p>
<p>There are still a things I’d love to do for Glitch Arena, but which are currently out of my league:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Publish dedicated server software
	<li>Create bots and AI for a single player experience 
	<li>Integrate steamworks for user-create content 
	<li>More time to spend on backgrounds and materials
	</ul>
	
<h2>Frag Forest</h2>
<p>Design and Development</p>

<p>Frag forest was my first attempt at a game. It currently exists as a playable, but unpublished prototype. </p>
<p>I had been lamenting for some time that my favourite genre was doomed because of the high barrier to entry that mechanical skills presented. These are skills that need to be practiced before the game can be enjoyed. The main prohibitive skills are mouse aim and movement abilities such as strafe jumping. While one of the good things about AFPS is the high skill ceiling, these games sadly require a huge investment of time. </p>
<p>I was wondering if the non-mechanical aspects of the genre are independently enjoyable. What if those elements were available in a more accessible format? This sparked Frag Forest. The idea was to translate the important elements of the Arena First Person Shooter genre, but into a 2D format that could be played with less mechanical skill. In this sense it’s a direct theoretical precursor to Glitch. </p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p> Unlike Glitch, before I started building the game - which was quite a scary as until this point I had only been learning Unreal Engine by modding for Unreal Tournament - I prepared a game design document and shared it with Joel. Once I got into development and we were play testing the game, things evolved a little, but we remained faithful to the basic concept. <p>
