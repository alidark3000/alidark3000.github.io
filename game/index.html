  <h1>Game & Level Design Portfolio</h1>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p> My main experience is in level design, with some ability to develop in Unreal blueprints, and some creative skill with environments. I have heaps of experience with Unreal Engine but will need to learn other engines, whcih I'm more than happy to do.</p> 
      
  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>To contribute to a team that values hugely fun and engaging gameplay - through great and original level design. I have some design experience so also appreciate well planned projects that start with a strong vision.</p>
  
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Design levels and games have been a great hobby for the last give years, alongside a design career. I'm looking forward to switching into a more engaging creative avenue.</p>
  <p>I love the collaborative and iterative nature of game design. I value atmosphere over fidelity, and believe in creating fun through simple rules and well designed level devices</p> 
<p>Experience in:</p>
<ul>
	<li>designing and developing a released multiplayer FPS game 
	<li>designing levels for said indie AFPS and the cancelled but alive Unreal Tournament 4 
	<li>designing and developing a multiplayer platformer 
</ul>

<h2 id="glitch">Glitch Arena</h2>
<p>Design and development</p>
<p>Glitch Arena is an Arena First Person Shooter genre game. It’s published on Steam and mostly bug-free. Level design is ongoing. </p>
<p>Chronologically, I was designing levels and making mods for for UT4, then making a platformer, then working on Glitch Arena, but I'll introduce Glitch first as it's the magnum opus.</p>
<p>For this game I needed to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design best-in-class levels
	<li>Develop a fluid movement system in the linear ue4
	<li>Make blueprints for all actors and classes, from scratch
	<li>Design gameplay, gamemodes
	<li>Design levels for various gametypes
	<li>Produce level and menu music
	<li>Produce game sounds
	<li>Create pixel art materials with normals
	<li>Integrate basic Steam functions and Published game
</ul>

<h3>Concept</h3>

<p>Glitch was first proposed to my partner in all things game and level, Joel Reeves, who I met through the Australian UT4 community. He helped playtest levels and has had input in most of what I’ve done. The initial pitch to him was for an AFPS that took the basic principles of AFPS and presented them as minimally as possible. </p>
    
<p>Glitch is inspired by two types of AFPS games, Quake and Unreal Tournament, and strives to integrate the best thigns about both. This results in a fast and fluid game like Quake, that also has the fun, dynamic engagements of Unreal.</p>

<p>Before making Glitch, I saw where the genre I loved was heading. Regretfully, it seemed to be getting more and more complicated. Glitch was meant from the start to be the antithesis of this. The idea is that that complicated game systems are a net negative. For AFPS at least, a simple array of pickups and tools could be more fun in conjunction with good level design. I think we proved this (!). We started with the absolute minimum of AFPS gameplay devices - weapons, armour, health and ammunition, and added a few nice-to-haves and differentiators. <p>
  
  <p>This video goes into some detail on our design and decision-making process: </p>

  <p>To pull out one example as a way we innovated on the genre with an essentialist approach, every other AFPS game offers ammunition for each weapon in the game separately. This increases the mental overhead. In Glitch you have a unified ammunition which each weapon in the game uses. This means you only need to track one value, learning maps is easier, and the gameplay can be picked up, and enjoyed, faster. </p>
  
  <p>The game was designed and built along with the levels, in Unreal Engine. It’s a blueprint only project as that’s how I code (and where I draw the line). At two and a half years into the project, there are a number of levels I’m really happy with. Of course making these took extensive collaboration and testing for which I have Joel to thank. </p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately interest in the game never allowed for testing team modes, including the original capture the balls mode, which is explained in this video (it was publicly playable for a while until I realised how buggy it was, but was thoroughly enjoyed by some). The idea was to improve on the Capture the Flag formula by highlighting the hide-and-seek nature of the mode (This forensic video of me hiding with the flag in UT4 explains what I mean!).  </p>
    
    <h3>Level Design</h3>
    <p>Building a unique game, I enjoyed making levels to support the new ideas.  The levels took shape alongside the gameplay, over time. They are defiantely informed by other AFPS levels, however I wanted to create a group of highly unique maps that explored what was possible. There's more work to do here, but I'm very proud of a few of them.</p>
    
    <p> This video features Joel and I duelling on "Key3" (the working title stuck), probably the most realised map in the game. The gameplay is from Joel's POV. His feedback was crucial while working on Key3.</p>

  <h3>Future</h3>
  
  <p>After more than two years of development, the core of Glitch is done and dusted. Level design, though, is an ongoing hobby. </p>
<p>There are still a things I’d love to do for Glitch Arena, but which are currently out of my league:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Publish dedicated server software
	<li>Create bots and AI for a single player experience 
	<li>Integrate steamworks for user-create content 
	<li>More time to spend on backgrounds and materials
	</ul>
	
<h2 id="ff">Frag Forest</h2>
<p>Design and Development</p>

<p>Frag forest was my first attempt at a game. It currently exists as a playable, but unpublished prototype. </p>
<p>I had been lamenting for some time that my favourite genre was doomed because of the high barrier to entry that mechanical skills presented. These are skills that need to be practiced before the game can be enjoyed. The main prohibitive skills are mouse aim and movement abilities such as strafe jumping. While one of the good things about AFPS is the high skill ceiling, these games sadly require a huge investment of time. </p>
<p>I was wondering if the non-mechanical aspects of the genre are independently enjoyable. What if those elements were available in a more accessible format? This sparked Frag Forest. The idea was to translate the important elements of the Arena First Person Shooter genre, but into a 2D format that could be played with less mechanical skill. In this sense it’s a direct theoretical precursor to Glitch. </p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p> Unlike Glitch, before I started building the game - which was quite a scary as until this point I had only been learning Unreal Engine by modding for Unreal Tournament - I prepared a game design document and shared it with Joel. Once I got into development and we were play testing the game, things evolved a little, but we remained faithful to the basic concept. <p>
    
    
<h2>UT4 Levels: Dying Sun & Lathe</h2>
    
    <p>Having played Unreal Tournament heavily since 2015, I started making maps and mods for the game in 2017. The best of these maps was Dying Sun, which evolved into a new circular version of the map, Lathe.</p>
    
    <p>The meta concept for Dying Sun is a strict separation of in control and out of control routes. In AFPS duel, players struggle for control, by which they maintain a position in which they can defend and keep the major items on a map. Players must know how to keep control, but also how to play "out of control" without dying, but while slowly winning back control. For Dying Sun, we intended to correct a problem with Unreal Tournament, in which control was too easy to keep and too hard to win back. I say 'we' because the idea was very much developed with from Joel.</p>
    
    <p>We did this by placing major items in Dying Sun at the ground level, in hard-to-defend and easy-to-attack locations. We also respawned players at a top level, with plenty of weapons and minor items to choose from, meaning they could easily restock and restack, and get reprive from the in control player's onslaught. </p>
    
    <p>The main features of the map are two lifts, located at opposite ends of the map, which served as the only ways from the lower levels to the top (except for one jump pad).Because of these strong sound cues, the top level player would always know when the bottom level player was attempting to track them down.</p> 
    
    <p>Dying Sun reached 100 playtested iterations before final release. Go on, watch them all! Or maybe just one:</p>

    <p>Lathe kept these most important features from Dying Sun, and was more an experiment in Unreal Engine's geometry.</p>
    
    <p>I made another couple of maps after these two, however these two recieved the most attention and represent what I learned from mapping for Unreal Tournament.</p>

    <h2 id="mods">Mods for UT4</h2>
        
    <p>After having started in mapping, I became interested in modding for Unreal Tournament. I guess it was pure creative curiousity. I had some ideas, and wanted to see how they played out. Doing this was how I learned to code in UE4 Blueprints, and key to building the confidence to make games. Multiplayer networking concepts particularly proved hard to learn, and boy did I put in the hard yards.</p>
    
    <h3>Airgun</h3>
    <p>This was my replacement started weapon for UT4, which was meant to replace the stock starting pistol, as well as the impact hammer that people could use to clear modest heights and increased map mobility.</p>
    
    <h3>Fluidity</h3>
    <p>Foreshadowing Glitch, fludity was my attempt to move the UT movement system towards Quake's. UT has very linear movement, while Quake's is fluid. Essentially, this allowed you to bunnyhop in UT.</p>
    
    <p> This video introduces both Airgun and Fluidity, as well as another good map I made Hack01.</p>

    <h3>Strafeboard</h3>
    <p>Strafeboard was another way to sneak fast and fluid movement into UT4, however in this case, it had precedent in the UT3 hoverboard. Players in capture the flag were able to switch to a hoverboard to move around the larger maps much faster than otherwise.</p>
    
    <p>Strafeboard incorporated Quake style movement tech to increase speed while on the board, another homage to Quake and a precursor to developing 'Glitching' later on.</p>

    <h3>Jetpack</h3>
    <p>The Jetpack was designed as a new powerup for UT4. It worked pretty simply and as you'd imagine.</p>
